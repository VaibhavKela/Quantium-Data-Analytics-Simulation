# Task 1: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This task focused on understanding and preparing the transaction and customer data for analysis.

### Key Steps:
- Cleaned transaction data (removed nulls, duplicates, fixed data types)
- Merged customer dataset with transaction dataset
- Extracted new features like `brand` and `pack size`
- Analyzed product-level and customer-level sales behavior
- Generated charts to visualize:
  - Top-selling chip products
  - Sales distribution by pack size
  - Customer segments by life stage and affluence

These insights laid the foundation for deeper customer analysis and recommendations.
